This action repo was started with what is explained here on
[nix.dev](https://nix.dev/tutorials/nixos/continuous-integration-github-actions#github-actions).

There are different ways to push artefacts to a personal cachix store, like
[my test one](https://app.cachix.org/cache/philipp-baumann). See the
[official cachix docs for more about it](https://docs.cachix.org/getting-started#pushing-binaries-with-cachix).
